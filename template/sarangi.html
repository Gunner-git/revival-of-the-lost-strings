			Sarangi

		<p class="content">
			The sarangi is often called the brother of the saranda as it was also introduced by the same guru, Guru Hargobind Singh at arround the same time as the saranda was created. It was only introduced into the sikh culture because it was created by the king of Sri Lanka at that time, who was <i>Ravana</i>, for meditative purposes. It is also called the instrument of a hundred colors as it has a 100 strings adding all the gut strings and the sympathetic strings in totality. The only difference between it and saranda is the square body at the head and the tuning pegs at the side. For the rest, the both are totally similar with the broad tail and the semi circular end or toe. It is also a bowed instrument and also has the element of the <i>meend</i>. Though, the sarangi is unable to be seen today in most gurudwaras because it was misused by a sinner by the name of Massa Rangharh who used it for intoxicating women and making them twerk in near-to-naked clothing inside the premise of the holy gurudwara of the golden temple (harmandir sahib).
