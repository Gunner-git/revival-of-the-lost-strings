			Taus
		</h1>
		<p class="content">
			 The Taus (pronounced taa-oo-s) was created by Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib as the instrument of the peacock as it has peacock hair attatched to the fretboard. It has 4 playable strings and 12 sympathetic strings. It is said that the name of the taus comes from the mughal throne of Aurangzeb the ruler of that time. He had recently built a mughal fort in Delhi and had passed the law that nobody could build a building higher than his fort. Along with that, he had built a throne of diamonds and emeralds called the takht-e-taus. Thus, when the ninth guru began retaliating against the mughl emperor, he first had his fort built 12 and a half inches taller than the previous fort and also made this beautiful instrument along with it and christening it with the name taus. It was the first instrument with clear emphasis on the <i>meend</i> and had a long bow allowing to play it. The fretboard of this instrument is longer than it's predecessors and was inspired by the sitar with huge rings signifying every note or <i>sur</i>. Later, this instrument was taken as inspiration for creating the dilruba which was largely loved by the sikhs going into war.
