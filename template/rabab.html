			Rabab
		</h1>
		<p class="content">
			The Rabab is a plucking instrument created by the first sikh guru, Guru Nanak Dev Ji. It has 3 playable strings and 12 sympathetic strings. According to legends, the rabab was crafted by a luthier by the name of Bhai Firanda. It was played by Bhai Mardana on Nanak's journeys called <i> udaasis</i>. The body of the rabab is generally crated by kashmiri wood and is shaped into a pointed oval at the head. With circular bends at the edges, the rabab descends into a slope making it more slim and grippable at the other end. The strings were made of animal skin and were earlier plucked via nails but as time progressed, the strings were made out of nylon and were plucked by a plastic plucker. According to Guru Granth Sahib Ji, the sikh religious scripture, the rabab produces a sound (called <i>naad</i>) which has the capability of purifying souls and making them capable of meeting the one lord. Mixed with the gurus' holy words (<i>baani</i>), it was the sole instrument used by the first guru to end <i>kalyuga</i> (the era of darkness and evil).

			Honorable players of the instrument
		</h1>
		<p class="content">
			There are not many who play this particular instrument in the sikh culture due to a cotntroversy of this model of the rabab being fake and the real one being different. However since there are multiple types of Rababs, there is no conclusive proof that this one is any different from the original one. However, there have been some Ustad Daud Khan Sadozai who specialize in the art of playing the instrument and all its types.

			My experience of playing the instrument
		</h1>
		<p class="content">
			Actually playing the instrument and hearing it emit those divine sounds which can only be expressed by the <i>tanti saaz</i> wass an enlightening experience. Full with the <i>meend</i> and the ambrosial nectar of the guru's <i>gurbani</i>, it sounded as serene as described in the literary works of <i>Kahn Singh Nabha</i> and <i>Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande</i> a wonderful job of describing the rabab's beautiful duality between a stringed but also a percussive instrument much like the piano of the west.
