			Dilruba
		</h1>
		<p class="content">
			The Dilruba is the successor to the Taus and has the same number of gut (4) and sympathetic (12) strings. It also has a long fretboard from the sitar and has the same rings notifying the notes or <i>sur</i>. The only difference between the Taus and the Dilruba is between the size and the head. The head of the dilruba is more square, unlike the oval shape of the taus. For the size, there is a lore which justifies the smaller form factor of the dilruba. It states that the sikh soldiers who went to war, had to maintain the sikh ritual of nitnem which asked them to perform all the prayers of the one lord before heading to battle. And many-a-times, this used to happen while on duty on horseback. But the weight of the taus weighed down the soldiers as well as their horses. So for that issue, the 10th guru, Guru Gobind Singh Ji ordered the invent of the Dilruba which basically served the same purpose as the Taus but was smaller in size for the ease of mobility. The Dilruba is the most popular toda of all the sikh instruments.
