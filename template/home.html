			The Revival of the Lost Strings

			Welcome to <i>Guru Nanak's</i> online darbar! Here, we carry forward his wishes and spread awareness about the <i>akaal purakh</i> in <i>Nanak's</i> way, and that too in his own style. Tired of the boring and common harmonium? Don't worry. We have 5 more stringed instruments for you, which you can pick to learn on your own preference. Moreover, these were the original instruments used by the sikh gurus and were meant to be used for <i>keertan</i> (singing the praises of the lord). These instruments emanate strong spiritual vibes which fill the environment with bliss, mesmerizing the audience. The key to this is the varying notes in accordance to mood which can only be achieved by stringed instruments. Historian and professor Surinder Singh states that in the earlier times, indian music and it's notes were heavily influenced by the muician's mood. There have been proofs found which say that even different scales were chosen for different times, moods and occasions. Bet you don't see that in the harmonium, do you. Most of the instruments even carry the blessing of the <i>meend</i>, which allows transition between the notes and notes between the discrete notes to be played on the instruments. For example, if you pick two western notes which are adjacent to each other (let's take C and C#), there is a specific note in between the two notes which can not be played in any other instrument set in the whole world. This is something very special in the instruments which make them ideal for <i>raag</i> based music in the sikh traditions. Feeling interested? Dive into the other 5 pages based on the specific instruments which cover the instruments' sppecialities and niches in more detail.
