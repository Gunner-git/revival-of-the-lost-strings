			Saranda
		</h1>
		<p class="content">
			The Saranda is a nepali lute-like instrument with 4 gut strings and 18 additional wire-like sympathetic strings. It came into the sikh culture after being introduced by the sixth guru, Guru Hargobind Sahib ji in his quest to widen the sikh literature (by inventing punjabi) and music culture by inventing the saranda and the sarangi. It has a ball like structure at the head and the same grooves at the edges as the rabab and a broad tail containing all the strings followed by a semi-circular foot containing all the tuning pegs. It is also one of the bowed instruments of the sikh culture and contains the element of the <i>meend</i>, the thread-like propperty of connecting on note or <i>sur</i> to another which is often supported by the analogy of the thought chain of the human mind which is also connected despite each individual thought having it's own identity. It was generally played along with either the <i>johri</i> or the <i>dhadd</i>, both of which are percussive instruments supporting the saranda nicely.
